By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```python
fibs = {1: 1, 2: 1}

def create_fib(n):
    global fibs
    if n in fibs:
        return fibs[n]
    else:
        fibs[n] = create_fib(n - 1) + create_fib(n - 2)
        return fibs[n]
```

```python
def get_fib_even_sum(end):
    total = 0
    current_value = 0
    n = 1
    while current_value < end:
        if current_value % 2 == 0:
            total += current_value
        current_value = create_fib(n)
        n += 1
    return total

print(get_fib_even_sum(4_000_000))
4613732
```

A cleaner and more Pythonic way would be to use `lru_cache` from `functools` in [Python3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html)

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
