In order to calculate terms of Fibonacci sequence efficiently, it will be useful to store them in a global dictionary so that every term is computed only once. Before calculating the value of a term, we will first check if we have already computed it. This removes the duplication of computing values and transforms the problem to O(n).

```python
fibs = {1: 1, 2: 1}

def create_fib(n):
    global fibs
    if n in fibs:
        return fibs[n]
    else:
        fibs[n] = create_fib(n - 1) + create_fib(n - 2)
        return fibs[n]
```

After finishing the `create_fib` function, we can now write a simple function that computes the sum of all even terms of Fibonacci sequence up to a given value and obtain the desired answer 4613732.

```python
def get_fib_even_sum(end):
    total = 0
    current_value = 0
    n = 1
    while current_value < end:
        if current_value % 2 == 0:
            total += current_value
        current_value = create_fib(n)
        n += 1
    return total

print(get_fib_even_sum(4_000_000))
```

    4613732
