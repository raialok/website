Hi, I am Alok. I enjoy writing code and prose. My primary interests are software engineering, programming languages, and distributed systems.

In my last career, I worked as a consultant. Now I am currently a software engineer in Paris at a Healthcare company, trying to build the best virtual patient care system.

I enjoy reading, hiking, and urban exploration.
