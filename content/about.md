Hi, I am Alok. I enjoy writing code and prose. My primary interests are software engineering, programming languages, and distributed systems including blockchain.

In my last career, I worked as a consultant helping companies navigate bureaucracy and regulations. Realising that I much rather build and take ownership for things, I switched to engineering. After finishing my Masters in Computer Science, I enjoyed teaching and researching for a while before transitioning into industry. I am currently a software engineer in Paris. I will be soon joining a Healthcare company, trying to build the best virtual patient care system.

I enjoy reading, hiking, and urban exploration.
