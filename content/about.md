Hi, I am Alok. I enjoy writing code and prose. My primary interests are software engineering, programming languages, and distributed systems including blockchain.

In my last career, I worked as a consultant. Realising that I much rather build and take responsibility for things over long term, I switched to engineering. I am currently a software engineer in Paris at a Healthcare company, trying to build the best virtual patient care system.

I enjoy reading, hiking, and urban exploration.
