Hi, I am Alok. I enjoy writing code and prose. My primary interests are software engineering, programming languages, and distributed systems including blockchain.

In my last career, I worked as a consultant. Realising that I much rather build and take responsibility for things over long term, I switched to engineering. After a productive sojourn of teaching and research in academia , I moved to industry. I am currently software engineer in Paris at a healthcare company.

I enjoy reading, hiking, and urban exploration.
