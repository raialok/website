The world is full of interesting problems whose solutions can improve our lives. I like to work on the subset of problems that can be solved with a combination of technological innovation and strategic thinking. I currently work as a software engineer in Paris. My primary interests are product management, artificial intelligence, and distributed systems.

In spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and urban exploration.
