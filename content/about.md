After finishing my Masters in Computer Science, I enjoyed teaching and researching for a while before transitioning into industry. I bring in technical skill from my computer science education, along with the understanding of processes and organisations from consulting career, the gestalt aimed at producing great products.

I am currently a software engineer in Paris. I will be soon joining a Healthcare company, trying to build the best virtual patient care system.

I enjoy reading, hiking, and urban exploration.
