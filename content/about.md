The world is full of interesting problems whose solutions can improve our lives.
With insane focus, skill, and sheer determination, many of these problems can be solved.
I like to work on that subset of the problems which can be solved with technological innovation and strategic thinking. I currently work as a software engineer in Paris. My primary interests are product management, artificial intelligence, and distributed systems.

In spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and urban exploration.
