The world is full of interesting problems whose solutions can make our lives better.
I like to work on that subset of problems which can be solved with a combination of
technical skills and strategic thinking. I currently work as a software engineer in Paris
and am interested in product management, artificial intelligence, and distributed systems.

In spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and urban exploration.
