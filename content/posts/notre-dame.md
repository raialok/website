Anguish clouds her delicate visage;
  Her Allure, cherished ornament of Seine;
  Cruel Tyche stuck, the dismay of Aphrodite, 
"Fear malice spirited away my grace !"

O her heart truly fears it now,
  Blazing flames feasted deranged;
  Mourning gargoyles lustily lamented,
"Will I remain stuck down so low ?" 

Something indeed she has lost,
  How resents being mere shell of agonies ,
  O, Deprive her of this unrelenting weakness,
"Wish only stand tall without support !"

Nameless, formless, fears stalk her moments
  Her candles no longer fight dark night;
  Yet dawn about to kindle the first light,
"Healed, I am to be joyous mistress of Paris !"
